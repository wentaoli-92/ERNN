# ERNN

## Purpose

This repository implements the algorithms mentioned in our VLDB 2024 paper (titled "Expanding Reverse Nearest Neighbors").

## Dataset

- All datasets used in the paper can be downloaded from link http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml.
- The used datasets are available in the data folder of this repository (other oversized datasets can be obtained from link https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9gmc1qjvbhiahjrk2ygsq/h?rlkey=fygkxf587t9dkgzcmw96efg2s&dl=0).
- The NH-d dataset is a small sample of the NH dataset that can be used to evaluate exact algorithms.
- In addition, the test.tmp dataset was not used in the paper, but can be used for testing purposes.
